# README Generator [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)  

## Description
As a developer I want a README generator so that I can quickly create a professional README for a new project.

Given a command-line application that accepts user input when I am prompted for information about my application repository then a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.
When I enter my project title then this is displayed as the title of the README.
When I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions then this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests.
When I choose a license for my application from a list of options then a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under.
When I enter my GitHub username then this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile.
When I enter my email address then this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions.
When I click on the links in the Table of Contents then I am taken to the corresponding section of the README.
